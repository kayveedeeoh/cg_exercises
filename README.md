# cg_exercises
silly and cool exercises for understanding things better

will generally include code examples in Houdini's VEX & Python, and Maya's Python API to start with.

Some rules:
- follow pep8
- make docstrings for classes & functions. helps others understand better.
- only comment where necessary. otherwise the code should speak for itself
- code as elegantly as possible
- please no camel casing for variables and function names. snake casing is preferred. eg: snake_casing_rules vs camelCasingSucks
- if external libraries are required to run, make a requirements.txt containing the pip install command for each.
