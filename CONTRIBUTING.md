- follow pep8
- make docstrings for classes & functions. helps others understand better.
- only comment where necessary. otherwise the code should speak for itself
- code as elegantly as possible
- please no camel casing for variables and function names.
  snake casing is preferred. eg: snake_casing_rules vs camelCasingSucks
- use pascal casing for classes. eg MyExampleClass
- if external libraries are required to run, make a requirements.txt containing the pip install command for each.
